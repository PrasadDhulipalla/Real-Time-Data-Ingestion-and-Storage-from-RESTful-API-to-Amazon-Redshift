# Real-Time-Data-Ingestion-and-Storage-from-RESTful-API-to-Amazon-Redshift

Designed and implemented a real-time data pipeline that streams data from RESTful APIs and stores it efficiently in Amazon Redshift for further analytics and reporting. This project showcases end-to-end data engineering skills including data extraction, transformation, and scalable storage.

Key Highlights:

Utilized Python and requests library for reliable API data ingestion

Performed data transformation and validation using Pandas

Leveraged AWS services to load data into Amazon Redshift using psycopg2 and boto3

Ensured automation, error handling, and performance optimization of the pipeline

Enabled near real-time analytics and dashboard reporting on Redshift data
